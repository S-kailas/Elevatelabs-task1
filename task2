TASK-2
Analyzing Phising emails 
By reviewing 4-5 phising mails that I got from the internet
     1. https://www.hooksecurity.co/phishing-examples/microsoft-phishing-example
     2. https://www.hooksecurity.co/phishing-examples/linkedin-phishing-example
     3. https://www.hooksecurity.co/phishing-examples/github-phishing-example
     4. https://www.hooksecurity.co/phishing-examples/fedex-phishing-example
     5. https://www.hooksecurity.co/phishing-examples/google-phishing-example
I understood some main things
     1. The content of phishing mails are mainly of two types:
                a) Threatening
                      eg; Your packaged items will be canclled, Someone signed into your account Immediatly sigin here etc 
                b)  Urgency 
                      eg: Sigin fastt to gain offers etc
Somehow to prevent us from getting trapped into it is understand a very basic thing: All these phishing things are leading to get the power that you only have 
                                         for example : Signing into the page that a attacker had made;Giving the power that you only have(Your account access)
So double check the mails,calls,etc 
There is also another thing I have found: The emails will be  very sus that we can see in this demo instead of support@github.com in phishing mails we can see github@companysupport.com

These are my findings
